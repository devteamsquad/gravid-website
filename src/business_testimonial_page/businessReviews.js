      "Grav.id has a fantastic team and so every single one of you have been extremely helpful as far as making sure this community is thriving. Being consistent with posting. It’s hard to keep up with the posts and I absolutely appreciate how the team here at Grav.id has been helping the Talent Upskill Network, being actively involved and engaged with the participants. You guys have changed the Talent Upskill community in a radical way where I feel really confident about continuing to use this platform to voice what’s working and what’s not and share different tips and strategies etc. Thank you so much. And most importantly, being consistent in following up with me. Especially Bolade, She’s been great as far as being consistent and keeping me in line with the projects.. With the Talent Upskill Network and so I highly recommend, definitely sign up for Grav.id. I know that you guys are on multiple platforms whether it’s iphone or andriod, I have an andriod myself. We’re on the Google Playstore. \n\n\n Grav.id is also great when it comes to the security of everything, SSI. That’s another huge topic of itself because there are several social media platforms out there, you don’t know who’s watching your information or who has access to your information. Here at Grav.id, you do. And by the way, I’m close friends too with Ninh, the founder and so we partner on other occasions as well. Shoutout to the Grav.id team, you guys are phenomenal.",

      "Grav.id, you know, you guys are my first sponsor. You’re there to help me through my different projects for different rooms, and to have my followers follow me in there where we can talk about my life, what I’m going through or anything that they are going through. These rooms, they are the projects that I have for GOALIFE, Mypawrents, and The Transplant Coin, which is coming soon. Mypawrents and GOALIFE are already live, and Grav.id will play a significant part in accomplishing everything that I need to get done. They’re helping me tremendously in doing everything that I need to get done.",
