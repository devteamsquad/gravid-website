      <p>
        The national legal frameworks of each member of the Grav.id
        ecosystem—such as those pertaining to employment and privacy—are
        followed by them. Making sure that businesses and individuals operating
        under various legal frameworks, regulations, and tactics may collaborate
        is the goal of legal interoperability. To guarantee operational
        consistency and legal clarity for each transaction, this calls for
        precise agreements to be signed by all parties involved.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for companies to engage in Network transactions, they must
        register their Decentralized Identifier (DID) with the Grav.id
        Registrar. Gav.id oversees and manages the registrar centrally.
        Organizations register their DID with the Network and submit their
        desired services to be offered only after they have been vetted by the
        registrar and have signed their participation agreement.
      </p>
      <h4 id="anti-trust-compliance">Anti-Trust Compliance</h4>
      <p>
        In order to bring interested companies together in a cooperative
        endeavor to create, maintain, safeguard, and advance specific
        initiatives outlined in the Bylaws “which are subject to periodic
        revision”Grav.id Foundation was established. Antitrust rules apply to
        these activities because competitors will be among the participants
        (referred to as "Members"). Even while it is entirely lawful for
        competitors to work together to accomplish pro-competitive objectives
        and efficiencies, it is crucial to recognize behavior that raises red
        flags in order to ensure that antitrust risks are minimized.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Foundation has made it clear that all of its operations, as well as
        those of any committees operating under its sponsorship, must be carried
        out strictly in compliance with all applicable international, state,
        federal, and local antitrust laws. The Establishment will not interfere
        with its Members' competitive business decisions, nor will it take or
        encourage any actions that could be interpreted as tending to restrict
        competition in contravention of antitrust laws.
      </p>
      <h4 id="board-of-directors">Board of Directors</h4>
      <p>
        The Board of Directors of the Foundation is in charge of running the
        organization. Each Foundation Member has one representative on the Board
        who was chosen by the entire membership. On every item presented to the
        Board for approval, each representative is allowed to cast one vote.
        They collaborate to decide on policies regarding the Grav.id governance
        as well as the incentives and payment scheme. During the first several
        months after the Network was established, the Founding Members kept a
        position on the board. Board members will be chosen by the entire
        membership in 2023 via the voting system.
      </p>
      <h4 id="voting-system">Voting System</h4>
      <p>
        The regulations that govern the conduct and determination of the results
        of elections and referendums are outlined in the Grav.id voting system.
        These regulations govern all parts of the voting process, including when
        elections are held, who is eligible to vote, who can run for office, how
        ballots are marked and cast, how they are tallied, and how the results
        of the vote are determined.
      </p>
      <h4 id="elections">Elections</h4>
      <p>
        Board members will be chosen annually by the entire membership as of
        2023. Every year, in the last month of the year, at a time determined by
        the acting Board of Directors, elections are held for the Board of
        Directors. The results of these elections will be implemented on January
        1st of the subsequent year.
      </p>
      <h4 id="candidates">Candidates</h4>
      <p>
        Organizations should notify the Board-appointed Voting Committee of
        their intention to nominate a delegate to the Board. The committee will
        make the list of candidate groups available to the general membership no
        later than 14 days before the scheduled elections.
      </p>
      <h4 id="eligibility-to-vote">Eligibility to Vote</h4>
      <p>
        Voting is restricted to organizations that are Members of the Foundation
        at the time of the election.
      </p>
      <h4 id="how-votes-are-counted">How Votes Are Counted</h4>
      <p>
        One vote is equivalent to each credit that is in use. The day before the
        election, a member's reserve credits will determine how many credits
        they can use to cast a vote.
      </p>
      <h4 id="referendums">Referendums</h4>
      <p>
        The Board may occasionally choose to hold a referendum on significant
        Network-related decisions. The same voting procedure used for elections
        is also used for administering referendums.

      <p>
        Every member of the Grav.id ecosystem operates under the confines of
        their respective country's legal system (e.g., employment, privacy).
        Ensuring that entities and individuals functioning under disparate legal
        frameworks, rules, and tactics can collaborate is known as legal
        interoperability. For each transaction to guarantee operational
        consistency and legal clarity, the various parties must sign explicit
        agreements. Organizations must register their Decentralized Identifier
        (DID) with the Grav.id Registrar in order to participate in Network
        transactions. Grav.id Foundation® is in charge of centrally managing the
        registrant. The organization doesn't proceed with registering its DID
        with the Network, submitting the services it wants to offer on the
        Network, or providing the keys and credentials needed to access the
        Network until after it has been cleared by the registrar and has signed
        its participation agreement. Following submission of the DID revisions,
        the Grav.id Registrar verifies the information against the participation
        agreements and, if authorized, publishes a Provider Certification for
        that company. This certification, which can be verified, enumerates the
        services that this company is able to provide on the Network.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each role within the Network requires a separate Participation
        Agreement:
